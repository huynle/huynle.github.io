It was shot at 5 in the morning on the way up to Mt. Beirdstadt (which is the peak on the right hand side). Here you can see the Sawtooth (in the middle) and Mt. Evans (on the left).</description></item><item><title>Long Way Home</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/long-way-home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2012 04:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/long-way-home/</guid><description>This is a scene from Hanging Lake. This was taken on the Dead Horse trail.. After hiking this trail, we found out why it was named the Dead Horse. And no.. there was no dead horse at the end of the trail, it was more of.. a trail that had steep loose jagged rocks that was nearly impossible to go up and was impossible to go back down. The best part was that the trail stopped and there was no clear path.</description></item></channel></rss>
