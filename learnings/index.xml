Firmware Stuff Firmware Write Protect Firmware is stored on a special SPI flash chip and has a special register that sets the device to read-only. This change be changed by special hardware and software measures.
The write protection of these chips are dependent on grounding a WP pin on the flash chip.
Specific to chromebook models after 2017+ (CR50 models), the state of the WP pin is controlled by the CR50 with close-case debugging (CCD).</description></item><item><title>SSL Protocol</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/ssl-protocol/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2017 04:42:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/ssl-protocol/</guid><description>Introduction Encryption use cryptographic pair, composed of a key and a certificate. Root pair is a cryptographic pair that is used to sign intermediates CAs.
Handshake SSL handshake uses asymmetric encryption first, then symmetric encryption after. Reason being, symmetric encryption is a lot faster.

This is good when you are developing on your own branches, but not good when we you working on public branch, more here
To merge or rebase master into a feature
git checkout feature git merge master # or.. a oneliner git merge master feature # say it in your head, git merge master into feature Rewriting history keeping a clean history is important This code snippets will allow you to interactively update commits for a particular branch.</description></item><item><title>Embedded Scratchpad</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/embedded-scratchpad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/embedded-scratchpad/</guid><description>Contents [Embedded Things to Consider](#Embedded Things to Consider) [Tools](#Embedded Things to Consider#Tools) [Potential Issues with Embedded](#Embedded Things to Consider#Potential Issues with Embedded) [Memory Management](#Embedded Things to Consider#Memory Management) [Mutex vs Semaphores](#Embedded Things to Consider#Mutex vs Semaphores) [Debugging Embedded Systems - Link here](#Embedded Things to Consider#Debugging Embedded Systems - Link here) [Examples](#Embedded Things to Consider#Examples) Resources Embedded Things to Consider Extremely useful article - https://www.</description></item><item><title>Getting Nvidia GPU to work on Ubuntu</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/getting-nvidia-gpu-to-work-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/getting-nvidia-gpu-to-work-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLE TO READ!
