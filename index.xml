Other things that excite me, is the world we live in.

Meanwhile we were doing our last gear check, a couple next to us (the only other people that rode with us to the trailhead on the shuttle) started talking and got into a small conversation. The only memorable thing about our little chat was when the gal said “… we don’t plan for our trips, that way, we would never be disappointed.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zion National Park</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/zion-national-park/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2013 01:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/zion-national-park/</guid><description>&lt;p>A week well before spring break, we had our gears ready and food prepared.

These rocks are called, cairn. This is of a cave at the end of joint trail, completely filled with cairn.</description></item><item><title>Here's to the 14ers</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/heres-to-the-14ers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 05:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/heres-to-the-14ers/</guid><description>This was taken a few weeks back when we went to hit up my first 14ers.

This was taken on the Dead Horse trail.. After hiking this trail, we found out why it was named the Dead Horse. And no.. there was no dead horse at the end of the trail, it was more of.. a trail that had steep loose jagged rocks that was nearly impossible to go up and was impossible to go back down. The best part was that the trail stopped and there was no clear path.</description></item><item><title>40 Years, Try 40 Hours</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/40-years-try-40-hours/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2012 14:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/40-years-try-40-hours/</guid><description>Just this past weekend, our youth group finished a camping trip. The camp was given a name, &amp;lsquo;Survival In Christ&amp;rsquo;. The theme is based off of the Book of Exodus and the 40 years that the Israelites spent in the desert. It was ironic how the Israelites spent 40 years in the desert, and we spent 40 hours in the hot summer sun. Through these 40 hours, there were blood, sweat and tear, literally.</description></item><item><title>Moab, Utah</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/moab-utah/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2012 16:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/moab-utah/</guid><description>&lt;p>We spend months before that Monday of Memorial Day, thinking about the trip, gathering up the gears and getting people to be on the same boat.
