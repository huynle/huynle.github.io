Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll find posts on lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, the things I find interesting, and what I am working on. Although I am not much of a writer, (really, it takes me a very long time to write together a post), it is an attempt to track my thoughts and share learnings through the years.
Although my interest is wide, you will most likely find contents regarding software and hardware development on this blog.</description></item><item><title>Keysight Oscilloscope</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/projects/keysight-oscilloscope/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/projects/keysight-oscilloscope/</guid><description>Start of keysight remote data collection project!
