So most configurations out there will use the Arduino Uno and a CNC shield. I decide to go with the Sainsmart RYC-GRBL-V2 hoping it would work out of the box.
The reason why this is a long post is because it didn't work out of the box.
To get it up and running these are the list of things I changed to get it working.</description></item><item><title>Theming</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/projects/theming/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2018 09:13:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/projects/theming/</guid><description>Getting Vim background to match with Tmux Use :hi to show all the colors for the current theme in vim

Played around and finally settled on Rafi's vim-config on GitHub. It had configurations for NeoVim as well as vim, and it had all the little things I was looking for when setting up Vim initially.

This was one of the main reason why I did not use it as often as I originally intended.
With a slew of difficulties, e.g. Z-wobble and first layer not adhering to the board. The K8200 soon became a project of it's own. In short, this is the start to making the K8200 be usable, as an everyday tool.</description></item><item><title>Blogging</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/projects/blogging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/projects/blogging/</guid><description>Todo: add search to static page Hosting blog github to gitlab

The better I like it!
I've been messing around with Notepad++, Atom for awhile for my text editing needs. Atom was especially nice with all the the packages you can install. Something that was definitely noteworthy is PlatformIO for my Arduino code editing.
But at the end of the day I needed an editor, that allows me to write all my codes and edit my blogs.</description></item><item><title>DJI Flamewheel 450</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/projects/dji-flamewheel-450/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/projects/dji-flamewheel-450/</guid><description>As I stepped back into the UAV world from a couple years of break, the industry have grown significant from when I graduated school.

While it is fun to play with, my initial goal of getting this laser is to prepare for my upcoming wedding in a couple of month. Looking around the web for party favor and other wedding related items, everything can add up very fast. So by getting this cheap Chinese laser, we are hoping to cut down the cost of our wedding, but also have a useful tool for the long term.</description></item><item><title>K8200</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/projects/k8200/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/projects/k8200/</guid><description>It's time to upgrade the K8200!
I purchased the 8200 in 2014. I was looking to use it as a tool for my projects. It works for its intended purpose, but it did not work well. Each time printing, it was a bit of a hassle getting all the right variables.
In an attempt to make printer a little more user friendly, I did modifications to make my life a little easier.</description></item><item><title>Keysight Oscilloscope</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/projects/keysight-oscilloscope/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/projects/keysight-oscilloscope/</guid><description>Start of keysight remote data collection project!
