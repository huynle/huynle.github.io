","permalink":"https://www.huynle.com/projects/initial-configs/","tags":["vim","editor"],"title":"Initial Configs"},{"categories":["Personal"],"contents":"Preparing for the Portland Marathon started about 6 months before. I was running before the registration, but on June 7th, 2017, I made a decision to run in the marathon. I have never ran a marathon before, and never even dreamed about running it. But after running with a close friend on a frequent basis, I got exposed to a technique that helped me through the training and the marathon itself.\nI was a long distance runner in high school; years ago. And ran a couple of dozen miles through college, in total. When I stared working, I ran maybe another dozen. My record for keeping a running log after high was not extensive. After I met a friend that ran marathons to raise money for Lukimia patients, I got interested in running again. Not for the sake of exercise itself, but to build my mental endurance. She spoke of this mental wall that people get when they run a marathon. It is where your mind just keeps telling your body to stop. I wanted to see what this was like. That was one of my main motivators that got me to hit that submit button and register for the Portland Marathon.\nThe Mind The thing that attracted me most about a marathon was the mental block that people keep talking about. People on the Sunstone RC team here at Intel say that at about 18 mile, they get a slapped in the face, and their body starts to show signs of giving up. After this point, it was mostly a mental game. Since I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on improving my mental endurance, this was an irresistible opportunity.\nThe Schedule Soon after I started training, I found consistencies was the key for me to finish the race. Leading up to the event, I made plans to train at home. It started out with 4 times a week, for a month or so. The schedule is shown below:\n   Day Duration Notes     Monday 30 min 7:30 pace   Wednesday 1 hr 8:30 pace   Friday 30 min 7:30 pace   Saturday 2 hrs 8:30 pace    This schedule, was then modified to three times a week due to youth group camps and summer events during weekends. So, the schedule changed again for the summer:\n   Day Duration Notes     Monday 1 hr 8:30 pace   Wednesday 30 min 7:30 pace   Friday 1 hr 8:30 pace    This schedule worked for a couple of weeks, then the summer got busy; friends and family were visiting out of town, I was traveling back and forth between Portland and Denver, and I got a puppy. So it got changed to once a week. On Wednesday, I was determined to run no matter what the weather was for 1 hour. So I did, this was the schedule for the last month of training for the marathon.\nBy no mean that this is a training schedule anyone to follow. If you look at the official marathon site, they create Saturday events for people to get out together to do long runs. Similarly, the Sunstone Running Crew at Intel also suggested long runs and had a very routine schedule. So if you are to run a marathon, this might not be the schedule you want to follow.\nTraining Method Even though my running schedule fluctuated over the 6 months of training and I was doing the bare minimal, there was one thing I kept consistent, my \u0026ldquo;time-to-rest\u0026rdquo;.\nThis \u0026ldquo;time-to-rest\u0026rdquo; is credited to Claire, who showed me that in a race, you can stop and take a walk. This was the pivotal point for me and convinced me that I can run 26.2 miles. The method calls for you to run however long you decided ahead of time, and take a prescribed break at the end of that period. Me \u0026ldquo;time-to-rest\u0026rdquo; was 15 minutes, and 1 minute of walking.\nSo, no matter much bad it was, if my timer is not on the 0, 15, 30, or 45 minute mark, I better be running. During training, this \u0026ldquo;time-to-rest\u0026rdquo; was an big encouragement for me to keep going and keeping the same pace. In my mind, it was not about how much longer until I reach home, but rather, I would keep asking and looking at my watch for the next break. I did not care where home was, my current goal at hand was to get that break that I need.\nThere were other things that I tried out during the training period also:\n Having a water bottle in hand when running Drinking electrolytes Bought energy food to eat during long runs  Here are my thoughts on these things.\nCarrying water - The extra water bottle was nice to have in hand because I would definitely be dehydrated during the run. It did not feel comfortable because I have to hold on to it and it made my hands and body felt uneven. It was okay for the training runs, but I would prefer not to carry anything if possible. I got around this by leaving water bottle along the route. Since I run a couple of loops around a small airport, I left it at an intersection to be picked up. But this was not necessary during the marathon. There was water stations along the route to not worry about this. In fact, during the marathon, I drank at least a cup of water at every station, and never once felt dehydrated.\nDrinking electrolytes - I got these in the tablets forms to dissolve in my water bottles. This definitely helped with my long runs with dehydration, but again, it was not comfortable to hold a water bottle and run. This was also solved during the marathon because there was energy drink at every water station also.\nEnergy Food - I was told that you will need food along the way. During the training period, I never once had food for my long runs. The reason why is because I would not be able to feel the effect of having food if my runs are only 14 miles. However, I did try to be hungry and eat half an almond butter and jelly sandwiches before my long runs just to see the affects of having food in my stomach. As I found out, I am okay to run with half a sandwich in my stomach. This is exactly what I did on race day, half and sandwich and no more; I saved the other half for the run.\nRace Day Race day came just like any normal day for me; I just remember praying extra hard that night, and extra hard that morning. The only thing I did different up to race day was to load up on carbs for the couple of days leading up to the race, I had the same running routine and the same eating/sleeping schedule.\nThat Sunday, I woke up at 4:55AM in order to get downtown in time for the race. Unlike other mornings, that morning I gulfed down half a banana and ate half of an almond butter and jelly sandwich put on my running attires and jumped in the car. Driving around downtown Portland was not as bad as I initially thought during that time, maybe because it is 6:00 AM and no one is up yet.\nStanding there are the starting the starting line by 6:30AM, everything was set. I looked around and the streets were filled with runners. I was in group C, which was the group that is estimated to run the marathon in 4 hours. This was the initial goal when I register anyway. Due to my training and knowing that I can keep at 8:30 min/mi pace for 14 miles, I directed myself to the front of the pack and was ready to take off. The marker went off, I hit a button on my watch to start the timer, and the race started at 7:05 AM for group C.\nI knew there was a long way to go, so I conserved my energy and warmed myself up for the first couple of miles. At this point in time, I did not really care how long the race was, I just wanted to experience that mental wall that stops me from running. I wanted to see if I can push myself through it, so I ran, just like I trained. When the 15-minute timer kicks in, I get my little break. I was okay for the first 30 minutes, but I realized if I\u0026rsquo;m going to run more than the 14 mile that I trained for, I had better start eating to replenish myself. So from the 30 minute mark on, every 15 minutes I take a bite of my sandwich.\nOf course, the sandwich did not last me through the entire race. I also had a honey waffle that I bought to try out during training but never had the chance to try. It was then or never. so I chipped away that waffle every 15 minute I had, and it was wonderful. I drank at least a small cup of water or energy drink at every station. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen miles into the race and I did not really feel anything, it was just like a normal run. At mile 18, I ran out of food. This is the part where I did not plan for. Luckily, at every station, there was gummy bears or pretzels. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this contributed to my crazy leg cramps at mile 25, but I took every offer for food I had, including donuts from bystanders.\nBesides the food, there was also the festivity that the Portland Marathon had. There were countless of bands, musicians, dj\u0026rsquo;s and supporters along the route. This was very nice, since it definitely took my mind off the run for awhile. And then, there was a beautiful scene at the top of St. John\u0026rsquo;s bridge. Oh gosh, the sun was rising, I was staring back into Portland, being on top of the bridge, running in the cool breeze. It was quite the experience.\nOne foot in front of the other, I did not really feel any ache or pain until mile 23. At this point I was desperate for any food I can find. The cups of gummy bears that were being offered, I took more than one to keep in my pocket \u0026ldquo;just-in-case\u0026rdquo; the next refueling station is far away. It definitely came in handy, immediate right after I had it in my pocket. At this point, I could feel my legs giving out. I could still run, but my legs were saying no. This definitely intensified when mile 24 and 25 rolled around. My thighs started to get tight and cramps were settling in. I pushed as hard as I could, but my 15-minute \u0026ldquo;time-to-break\u0026rdquo; went down to 10 minutes, then 5 minutes. I walked a little, I ran a little toward the last mile. I remembered screaming to a guy walking along the route, \u0026ldquo;WHERE IS THE FINISH LINE?!\u0026quot;. The last mile definitely seem like forever.\nI struggled a lot to keep my feet in front of one another at mile 25, and this story has a happy ending. I finished the race in 3 hrs and 52 minutes; 7 minutes faster than what I originally set out for! Here are the details:\n   Point Time Pace     Start 00:00:00 \u0026mdash;   3M 00:29:13 09:45   6M 00:53:48 08:12   13.1M 01:53:37 08:25   17M 02:27:19 08:40   21M 03:01:44 08:37   Finish 03:52:31 9:47    Finish Time: 3:52:31 hrs Average Pace: 08:53 min/mile\nSo I finished my first marathon, and learned lots about myself in the process. I am questioning, if I did not know the distance of a marathon, would I be able to push through those last few miles easier? It is all in my head to say that I should take it easier because I am near the end?\n","permalink":"https://www.huynle.com/thoughts/2017-portland-marathon/","tags":["Portland Marathon","training","physical"],"title":"2017 Portland Marathon"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The day before, a small group of us youth leaders packed our bags and drove from Portland to central Oregon to look for a camping spot to view the solar eclipse. After a couple of hours driving around to check out all our possible options, nothing seems quite right. It was all too expensive for a group of us to simply enjoy the solar eclipse. This meant we have to go to our backup plan and drive deep into the forest to find ourselves a primitive site. After much searching, we were lucky to grab one of the last couple of sites deep in the Detroit Lake at South Perry Campground. There we pitched tent and relaxed for the night.\nThat Monday morning, I woke up a little early. Sleeping in the car was good and warm, surprisingly. I roamed around the trail for awhile in my car looking for the ideal spot to watch the solar eclipse. We needed a place that was high and clear of obstructions. As I drove around the bends of the road, it was apparent that the road wraps around the side of the mountain and not the top. So, hiking to the top was ideal to catch this.\nI came back into the campsite, got water and prepared breakfast. Everyone else slowly got up from the cold night. Lexy and Leanna was cold sleeping in the sleeping bag without any padding on the bottom. But they did not so much say a word about how cold it was. I think they were trying to be tougher than they actually are, which is understandable, this being \u0026lsquo;man-camp\u0026rsquo; in their head. As we got ready for breakfast, I constantly kept my eyes on the watch. Being the first solar eclipse in my life, I did not know what to expect, at the same time I did not do all the possible researches about it. So, I thought the sky will get darker and darker when the Moon starts to eclipse the Sun. I found out that I was wrong later\u0026hellip;\nWe climbed up the west hills of the South Perry campground to reach a point at the top somehow. After about 30 min, we reached our destination. Everyone had their own thing to do. Some sat down and started staring at the sun, others ran around to take picture; I was one of those \u0026lsquo;others\u0026rsquo;. I setup a Gopro to capture the timelapse at 1-sec interval. But other than that I had my DSLR with a 200mm lens ready.\nThe moment came a lot faster than I thought. I remember sitting there looking up at the sun when it was about 80 percent covered, and it seemed normal; it was just daylight here. As the moon continue its motion over the Sun, the ground got cooler as I was sitting there, and twilight started all around us. It was a weird feeling, I just remember being frantic. As the eclipse was coming to 100 percent, I constantly took pictures on my camera and tried to look at the sun at the same time. After a little while, I realized that my picture\u0026hellip; was and will just be a picture of a white circular dot. So I jumped over to switching my lens to capture a wider angle and to record everyone. I was all over the place! As I was doing this, I quickly realized totality was coming to an end. I did not remember staring at the sun for more than a couple of seconds at a time since I was a bit busy with my cameras. This is something I would do different next time; spend more time enjoying rather than fumbling around with pictures and capturing the moment.\nWhen totality end, you can see rays of light emerging from the edge of th the eclipse. This was when I relaxed a little and noticed that the last two minutes was pretty frantic for me. So, I stopped everything and decided to sit there and enjoy the last stages of the eclipse. This was my peaceful moment! I was able to just lay there on the rock and just observe the Sun and the Moon doing its celestrial dance. With the final stage, the horizon went from dark to twilight. The hues that surrounds the mountains was just indescribable. Again, I tried to capture this moment on my camera rather than simply enjoy. It was not until about 95 percent eclipse did I really sit down and enjoyed the moment.\nThe little things I noticed the air. The gradient of temperature of the air was at the moment struck the awe in me. It was amazing to see how the earth can change COMPLETELY if we were to lack the Sun for a little bit.\n  Solar eclipse moment  This was a pretty cool moment. Leading up to that moment was totally worthwhile also. We left the house at 8AM that morning and tried to look for a campsite, traffic was good until we got to Madras, the epicenter of the \u0026ldquo;solartown\u0026rdquo;  People were lined to get campsites, most of these guys were from California. This was apparent on their license plate   We drove out first to Smith Rock looking for a primitive campsite. When we got there, the site was full and cars couldn\u0026rsquo;t go in. So we decided to go to Jasper State Park in Prineville, OR. This was quickly changed to going closer to Madras. The reason being that there was countless of campsite around town; these are sites that farms have cleared their fields to accommodate visitors. With these popping up everywhere as we drove, the option was much better that we might try to find a site closer and pay just a little. But ideally, we dont want to pay for a campsite.  Smith Rock State Park -\u0026gt; Prinveville -\u0026gt; Billy Chinook State park was the backup plan that we had We skipped Prineville and went to Billy Chinook, but along the way we stopped by multiple \u0026ldquo;farm\u0026rsquo;s campsites\u0026rdquo; to get an ideal of the pricing. It seems like everyone in town is averaging about $25 per person per night. This means that our group of 13 would have cost $200+. We we asked for discount, the lowest we can get it is $150. This was alright\u0026hellip; but we did not want to settle for $150 at all.   We stuck to our plan and let everyone off at a boat dock and took off into the Northwest region of Billy Chinook lake to South Perry Campground.  It was initially disappointing since we could not find any campsites; it seems to us, we were a couple of minute late to reserve a campsite. As we were about to drive back out to the group, God gave me a little nudge to go check out the campsite on the other side of South Perry.  Lo and behold, sitting around at a small campsite and checking out the signs for camping regulation, we met the camp host, Scott. He was nice enough to say it was okay for us to park multiple cars at the small campsite. The split second were were about to pitch tent and reserve our site, he drove backward and pointed us to a much bigger and larger site! -\u0026gt; God send! =)   So that was that, we got one of the biggest campsite at South Perry campground. Drove back and gathered the crew out to the hidden campground.   When everyone got there, we proceed to set up a camp and started cooking food  I can kinda see the quarrel between Lexy and Leanna and the other girls at this point. They don\u0026rsquo;t really talk to each other as much, and if they did it was a few sentences.  Leanna and Lexy proceeded to take on the task of cooking and preparing food, as the others kinda stood around and waited. After awhile everyone was sent to the boat dock to go explore   After dinner, we played Catan at night and went out for some night picture      ","permalink":"https://www.huynle.com/thoughts/solar-eclipse/","tags":null,"title":"Solar Eclipse"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;m not sure about a lot of people, but I was constantly surprise by my credit card statement each month as I pay off my credit card.

Caveats  When instantiating forms, pay attention if there should be any input that are needed  By having this, file upload could not work and will keep failing    Quickstart WSGI application is Flask itself.\nfrom flask import flask app = Flask(__name__) Important Concepts  Blueprints: helps with the extension or construction of an application  HTML include and extends for jinja2 are fundamentally different. Note this. {% include 'nav.html' %} - this will include all the text in the nav.html to the layout {% extends 'layout.html' %} - this pulls in the html from layout.html and fill the block\nA Webapp  a view is a handlers for route requests  a view function ouputs text in HTML to be rendered by browser   templates - separates logic from layout  important rules  templates cannot make assumption about what logic gives   dynamic contents are enclused in {{ ... }}  is \u0026ldquo;{{ }}\u0026rdquo; double brackets used for variables and single used for control statement? Flask is default to Jinja2 templating when flask render_template it uses the kwargs as dictionary to fill in the dynamic content   can you stack html templates together to build a coeherrent page?  yes, this can be done with block control statement with Jinja2  \u0026lsquo;blocks\u0026rsquo; are given a unique name to reference in their respective templates   extends directive for Jinja2 establishes the inheritance between different templates  tells Jinja2 to \u0026lsquo;include\u0026rsquo; the current page to the extended page     subtemplating  just have to use {% include 'template.html' %} wherever the code is needed     webforms  Flask-WTF?  the form object is an inheritance from from flask_wtf import FlaskForm as Form \u0026ldquo;Wraps WTForms project in a way that integrates nicely with Flask apps\u0026rdquo; for Flask-WTF to work, a configuration page is needed  use config.py in the root folder  WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = True  if this is set True then in the HTML form. The {{ form.hidden_tag() }} must be included   SECRET_KEY = 'you-will-never-guess' The secret key is needed to validate the form, making the form more secure     The form is used by inheriting the Form class from flask_wtf  The fields are created from instantiating wtforms object  openid = StringField('openid', validators=[DataRequired()]) these attributes are then used in the HTML form by {{ form.openid }} TODO: understand why \u0026lsquo;Sign In\u0026rsquo; only registered the first word       Form-view: instantiate a Form object, use that class to fill in the templates With wtform the validation of the fields can be done by using the validator attribute when instantiating the class  form.validate_on_submit() returns a False if the user has not got a chance to input info \u0026lsquo;field\u0026rsquo; object from the WTForm will have an error attribute in form.field_name.errors if there is an attached validator to it   flash - a way to debug, and provide visual feedback to user  has to be turned on in the templates; update this in the base template   HTML table  \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; is for table row \u0026lt;th\u0026gt; is for table header \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; is for table data     DB in app  using the concept of \u0026ldquo;models\u0026rdquo;  models allow us to create the structure and retrieve from the database efficiently  this means that accessing row attributes is easy by notation and not using SQL itself   allow populating it easy  what about fixing and removing??     migrating when a new \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo; is introduced is important to writing good software  this needs further investigations/learnings   DB upgrade/downgrade is necessary when development  since the DB could change from one rev to the next rev of development, the ability to bring back the old DB is essential scripts are used to take care of this.. read further in to the FLASK TUTORIALS   DB is updated by updating the object itself and add and commit Database relationship  One-to-many  user -\u0026gt; posts, a user have many posts  this one to many is linked by the foreign key, ie. foreign_key = author -\u0026gt; link to posts     Many-to-Many  eg. students to teachers  to represent this in DB, an association table is needed the association table contains two foreign keys   since students and teachers are both people  a many-to-many relationship association table would have self-referential relationship     One-to-one  similar to one-to-many, it will be a constrain on the DB to have too \u0026lsquo;many\u0026rsquo;     the DB can be queried with SQLAlchemy very efficiently -It is better to keep the DB object rather than the results of the query   User Login  lets worry about Oauth sign in later\u0026hellip; https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/oauth-authentication-with-flask Flask-Login requires the User model to have certain properties    Unittests  add robustness to the code    Email Server  python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25  starts a debugging python email server for testing      MAIL_SERVER = 'localhost' MAIL_PORT = 25 MAIL_USERNAME = None MAIL_PASSWORD = None   full text search\n flask_whooshalchemy does not support python3    PostMan\n OpenID  The Open ID has some kind of token request in the back that prevents Postman to run? if used OAuth 2.0 then might work?

Population/10000 Used to derive values from data    SQL Formatting - white spaces dont matter - pick a format and stick to it! Below is a sample of what a readable SQL line would look like.\nSELECT * FROM track WHERE album_id \u0026gt; 1 ORDER BY title; There are a lot of dialects of SQL out there. We are concentrating on SQLite for this post.\nWhat you need to know about SQL is that there are clauses and expressions. Clauses are defined function defined by SQL, and expressions are function defined by the user.\nBasics - Up and Running Understanding the order of operation for SQL was difficult to grasp initially. The following rough outline should help with that..\nFirst thing to note! SQL works from the inside clause out! The important relationship to note is the three following where row and columns data are being moved\nIf SELECT:WHERE then GROUP BY:HAVING\nThis simply means that WHERE is the filter used for SELECT and HAVING is the filter for GROUP BY. When filter is mentioned, imagine an expression that the filter have to meet; just like A \u0026gt; 10. If the expression is met, then the row gets to stays in the query.\nAnother thing to note about SQL is the order of execution, it is fundamentally different from other programming languages. A regular functional programming language like that of Python of C++ would have the outer function run first. Then if it sees an inside function, that function is then executed and exit, and the outer function would be pick up what was evaluated. Python and C++, are performing actions, ie. functional programming. SQL, on the other end of the spectrum, it is storing and manipulating data, it is an ASKING language. Imagine a Venn diagram where each table is a circle, SQL allows us to ask for stack different tables together to form a result.\nSQLite have a lot of clauses and statements, the four clauses that were introduced are the basic clauses that you would need to get up and running.\nHAVING - This is a clause. It can only be use in conjunction with GROUP BY clause. HAVING follows by an expression that is evaluated per row from the table. GROUP BY - This is a clause to group the results of HAVING by whatever expression you choose. SELECT - This is a statement. This statement is an aggregates the results of the GROUP BY clause.\nJust from these four clauses. You can write you basic SQL to get almost anything you need. An example of this is.\nTable1\n   id desire_col2     1 value1   2 value2   3 value_sample   4 value_sample    SELECT new_name.id AS \u0026#39;Actual Column Display Name\u0026#39; -- 5. finally display the results after the filter, with the actual name you want the column to look like  FROM table1 new_name -- 3. table1 is renamed to `new_name`  WHERE new_name.id \u0026gt; 1 -- 4. the `new_name` is now being used to filter for id greater than 1  GROUP BY table1.desire_col2 -- 2. the results is should only contain rows with `id` 2,3,4. This is then grouped by value in desire_col2  HAVING table1.id \u0026gt; 1 -- 1. It starts here, with table1, get any value of the \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; that is greater than 2 A Little More - to be completed Let\u0026rsquo;s start breaking the previous into separate tables that we can start to visualize where how it is worked\nSELECT new_name.id AS \u0026#39;Actual Column Display Name\u0026#39; -- 5. finally display the results after the filter, with the actual name you want the column to look like  FROM table1 new_name -- 3. table1 is renamed to `new_name`  WHERE new_name.id \u0026gt; 1 -- 4. the `new_name` is now being used to filter for id greater than 1  GROUP BY table1.desire_col2 -- 2. the results is should only contain rows with `id` 2,3,4. This is then grouped by value in desire_col2  HAVING table1.id \u0026gt; 1 -- 1. It starts here, with table1, get any value of the \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; that is greater than 2 The table is broken down to have \u0026lsquo;id\u0026rsquo; greater than 1\n   id desire_col2     2 value2   3 value_sample   4 value_sample      Table2\n   desire_col1 desire_col2     1 some string1   2 some string2   3 some string3   4 some string4    A Little Bit More Advance! Do you want to select from more than one query, UNION brings all of that together.\nBasic Syntax Notes SELECT * FROM TABLE SQL use SINGLE QUOTE for text!\n NULL is a value that can be used a \u0026lsquo;idk\u0026rsquo; placeholder  When searching for NULL value, sqlite have a special ISNULL syntax    Dialects of SQL is not standard. There is a standard core set of syntax that all SQL share, but there are many specific syntax that do not match from one to the other.\nUsing SELECT    Selecting Row Command Notes     SELECT * FROM table     Selecting, using Filter and Counting Rows  WHERE is use to help filter the rows after the columns are selected  Just like a condition statement in python if: WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'TEST' FROM track WHERE album_id \u0026lt; 17 AND album_id \u0026gt; 5 AND track_number = 5 SELECT title AS Title FROM track WHERE album_id \u0026lt; 17 AND album_id \u0026gt; 5 AND track_number = 5 Logical Operation Table  In WHERE cond1, cond1 is a Boolean expression and bind together by Boolean operator     the order of commands seems to matter, FROM ___ WHERE ____ ORDER BY ___ LIMIT ____  Aggregate function = return one value for a set of result\n   Selecting Row Command Notes     SELECT col1, col2 FROM table Get columns in table for all rows   SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE col1 = value_to_match This filter the rows by having a condition on the results. These also like   SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE col1 = value_to_match LIMIT 3 This further filter the rows by having a condition on the results and limit the numbers of rows output   SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'TEST' FROM track WHERE album_id \u0026lt; 17 AND album_id \u0026gt; 5 LIMIT 4    SELECT COUNT(x) FROM table return the a single value for the number of rows.    boolean operation* |Boolean Operator|Note| |\u0026mdash;|\u0026mdash;| |LIKE %island%|the % is a wildcard in SQL just like * matches **zero or more** |LIKE _sland%|the _ is a wildcard that matches **one** |IN ('item1', 'item2')| use to match value in a list\ndistinct filtering Selecting Distinct in Values\nSELECT DISTINCT title from track; SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(title) from track; SELECT DISTINCT album_id, track_number from track; -- this allows to get Distinct items across two differnet columns order filtering\nSELECT DISTINCT album_id, track_number FROM track ORDER BY album_id; -- ascending order, default ASC SELECT DISTINCT album_id, track_number FROM track ORDER BY album_id DESC; -- descending order SELECT DISTINCT album_id, track_number FROM track ORDER BY album_id DESC, track_number; -- descending order of in the first list, then ascending order in the track_number list the modifier of ASC and DESC applied to any column that is the ORDER is used\nconditional Expression with CASE exprression\nSELECT CASE WHEN album_id = 1 and track_number \u0026gt; 2 THEN \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; ELSE \u0026#39;false\u0026#39; END as boolA, CASE WHEN album_id = 1 and track_number \u0026lt; 1 THEN \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; ELSE \u0026#39;false\u0026#39; END as boolB FROM track this creates a new table with two columns. \u0026lsquo;boolA\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;boolB\u0026rsquo; with value of each row being evaluated for the condition stated. when SELECT DISTINCT is used, then the result is further filtered\nanother form is for writing with CASE\nCASE album_id WHEN 1 THEN \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; ELSE \u0026#39;false\u0026#39; END as boolA Selecting Columns    Selecting Columns Command Notes     SELECT * FROM table Get all columns from a table   SELECT name, title FROM album Get name and title columns in table albumns   SELECT Name as 'First Name', Title FROM my_table clean up column names by using AS -\u0026gt; eg.

Can also be used without AS -\u0026gt; SELECT Name 'First Name', Title FROM my_table    Inserting Rows INSERT INTO track (album_id) VALUES ('dfa'); SELECT * FROM track;\n not all columns have to be filled, DB will be filled with null integer can be inserted as string with \u0026lsquo;value\u0026rsquo; or the literal integer itself ID is automatically generated on insert  Update Rows Special value of NULL can be used also. if condition is use to find NULL, then SQLite have a syntax ISNULL to find\nUPDATE track SET album_id = \u0026#39;new_id\u0026#39; WHERE id = 72; SELECT * FROM track; it looks like the syntax follow.. UPDATE table SET value WHERE conditional\n WHERE will try to find the row by conditions sets, multiple row can be set at the same time  When where is not fulfilled, then the insert statement is passed    Delete statement DELETE FROM track WHERE album_id ISNULL; to make sure that you are deleting the right row, do a SELECT * FROM album WHERE condition to help identity the correct row\nRelational many-to-one, one-to-many relationship\nCreate Table can create table in memory?\nCREATE TABLE test( a INTEGER, -- column per row help with formatting  b TEXT -- last column SHOULD NOT HAVE comma ); -- an empty table is created at this point INSERT INTO test (a, b) VALUES (1,2); INSERT INTO test VALUES (2,3); -- can also be inserted implicitly INSERT INTO test (b) VALUES (2); -- can optionally insert INSERT INTO test (a, b) SELECT a, b From test; -- this inserts another table that as queried, in this case. this is added upon itself DROP TABLE test; SELECT * FROM test; -- expecting error here, since the table is deleted Note:\n INSERT INTO test (a, b) SELECT a, b From test; is a valuable technique to temporary store persistent results from a query Delete statement DELETE FROM test WHERE a ISNULL; is destructive and it would be beneficial to preview the rows that are being deleted with SELECT * FROM test WHERE a ISNULL  Working with NULL and Constraint INSERT INTO test(b) VALUES (1); SELECT * FROM test WHERE a IS NULL; ISNULL or IS NULL both produce the same result, coversely there is IS NOT NULL\nTo create a table with a NOT NULL constraint\nCREATE TABLE constraint_test( a INTEGER UNIQUE , -- column per row help with formatting  b BOOLEAN NOT NULL, -- last column SHOULD NOT HAVE comma  c TEXT DEFAULT \u0026#39;MY DEFAULT VALUE!!!!\u0026#39; ); INSERT INTO not_null_test(a,b) VALUES (1,2); -- this would create an item with \u0026#39;MY DEFAULT VALUE!!!\u0026#39; for column C INSERT INTO not_null_test(b) VALUES (1); -- this would throw an error because cannot have NULL Ensuring the value in each column is unique\nColumn constraint Table |col_name TYPE CONSTAINT|Note| |\u0026mdash;|\u0026mdash;| |name INTEGER| value to be an integer |name INTEGER UNIQUE| make sure that the name in this column is unique, NULL is exempted |name INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL| make sure that the name in this column is unique, NULL is NOT exempted |name INTEGER NOT NULL| make sure that the name in this column has a value when creating row |name INTEGER DEFAULT '123123'| if not specified, the default value will be used |name INTEGER UNIQUE| make sure that the name in this column is unique |name INTEGER PRIMARY KEY| make the column a key column, and new ID will be auto-gen for each entry. note THIS IS FOR SQLite specific. significantly different for each dialect.\nchange table schema useful when need to add column\nALTER TABLE my_table ADD d TEXT; ALTER TABLE my_table ADD e TEXT DEFAULT \u0026#39;my default value\u0026#39;; adding column allow for default value but NOT NULL flag is not doable\n Important Note: The \u0026lsquo;ALTER TABLE \u0026hellip; RENAME TO \u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; command does not update action statements within triggers or SELECT statements within views. If the table being renamed is referenced from within triggers or views, then those triggers and views must be dropped and recreated separately by the application.\n Create an ID Column creating ID column is DIFFERENT on different system! This is for SQLite\nCREATE TABLE constraint_test( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, a INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- column per row help with formatting  b TEXT NOT NULL, -- last column SHOULD NOT HAVE comma  c TEXT DEFAULT \u0026#39;MY DEFAULT VALUE\u0026#39; ); Table Joins Unique id fields are used to create simple or complex tables\n   Type Syntax Note     Inner Join join default join   Outer Left Join left Include rows where the condition is met, but row where condition is not met on the left table. To do right join, simple reverse table inputs    SELECT track.duration AS dur, album.title FROM album JOIN track -- condition where both are met  ON track.album_id = album.id; -- condition where both are met this reports all the common row where track album id and album id is matched\nSELECT DISTINCT track.album_id AS album_id, album.title FROM album LEFT JOIN track ON track.album_id = album.id; -- reports rows where this condition is met, and not met on the left table Using DISTINCT this can be clearly seen that the LEFT JOIN is JOIN and any other row on the left handside\nmany-to-many relationship \u0026lsquo;junction table\u0026rsquo; allow many to many relationship. Allows relationship like a \u0026lsquo;product\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;customer\u0026rsquo;. Since a product can have many customers, and a customer can have many product\nClause Notes  GROUP BY  Group by will tell SQL to combine the unique groups into one row!  It will execute HAVING first before grouping  --show how many of each Locus there is  SELECT COUNT(*),Locus FROM Genes GROUP BY Locus --only show the groups that have more than one row in them  SELECT COUNT(*),Locus FROM Genes GROUP BY Locus HAVING COUNT(*)\u0026gt;1 --to just display all the rows for your condition, don\u0026#39;t use GROUP BY or HAVING  SELECT * FROM Genes WHERE Locus = \u0026#39;3\u0026#39; AND Chromosome = \u0026#39;10\u0026#39;     Notes Relationship between GROUP BY and SELECT, the aggregate function in the SELECT statement uses the GROUP BY columns\n All columns in the SELECT clause that do not have an aggregate need to be in the GROUP BY\n -- good SELECT col1, col2, col3, MAX(col4) GROUP BY col1, col2, col3 -- Also good: SELECT col1, col2, col3, MAX(col4) GROUP BY col1, col2, col3, col5, col6 -- No other columns = no GROUP BY needed SELECT MAX(col4) -- Won\u0026#39;t work: SELECT col1, col2, col3, MAX(col4) GROUP BY col1, col2 -- Pointless: SELECT col1, col2, col3, MAX(col4) GROUP BY col1, col2, col3, MAX(col4)  ","permalink":"https://www.huynle.com/essentials/sql-basics/","tags":null,"title":"SQL Basics"},{"categories":["essentials","node"],"contents":"What is node Up and Running A new key distinctions\n nvm - Node version manager node - this is the main node engine npm - node package manager ~/.npmrc - configuration changes from global  These three items are key to keeping a node environment together!

Most of you have probably used Windows before you started using Ubuntu. During that time you might have needed to backup and restore your system. For Windows you would need proprietary software for which you would have to reboot your machine and boot into a special environment in which you could perform the backing-up/restoring (programs like Norton Ghost). During that time you might have wondered why it wasn't possible to just add the whole c:\\ to a big zip-file. This is impossible because in Windows, there are lots of files you can't copy or overwrite while they are being used, and therefore you needed specialized software to handle this. Well, I'm here to tell you that those things, just like rebooting, are Windows CrazyThings (tm). There's no need to use programs like Ghost to create backups of your Ubuntu system (or any Linux system, for that matter). In fact; using Ghost might be a very bad idea if you are using anything but ext2. Ext3, the default Ubuntu partition, is seen by Ghost as a damaged ext2 partition and does a very good job at screwing up your data. 1: Backing-up \u0026quot;What should I use to backup my system then?\u0026quot; might you ask. Easy; the same thing you use to backup/compress everything else; TAR. Unlike Windows, Linux doesn't restrict root access to anything, so you can just throw every single file on a partition in a TAR file! To do this, become root with Code: sudo su and go to the root of your filesystem (we use this in our example, but you can go anywhere you want your backup to end up, including remote or removable drives.) Code: cd / Now, below is the full command I would use to make a backup of my system: Code: tar cvpzf backup.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/backup.tgz --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys / Now, lets explain this a little bit. The 'tar' part is, obviously, the program we're going to use. 'cvpfz' are the options we give to tar, like 'create archive' (obviously), 'preserve permissions'(to keep the same permissions on everything the same), and 'gzip' to keep the size down. Next, the name the archive is going to get. backup.tgz in our example. Next comes the root of the directory we want to backup. Since we want to backup everything; / Now come the directories we want to exclude. We don't want to backup everything since some dirs aren't very useful to include. Also make sure you don't include the file itself, or else you'll get weird results. You might also not want to include the /mnt folder if you have other partitions mounted there or you'll end up backing those up too. Also make sure you don't have anything mounted in /media (i.e. don't have any cd's or removable media mounted). Either that or exclude /media. EDIT : kvidell suggests below we also exclude the /dev directory. I have other evidence that says it is very unwise to do so though. Well, if the command agrees with you, hit enter (or return, whatever) and sit back\u0026amp;relax. This might take a while. Afterwards you'll have a file called backup.tgz in the root of your filessytem, which is probably pretty large. Now you can burn it to DVD or move it to another machine, whatever you like! EDIT2: At the end of the process you might get a message along the lines of 'tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors' or something, but in most cases you can just ignore that. Alternatively, you can use Bzip2 to compress your backup. This means higher compression but lower speed. If compression is important to you, just substitute the 'z' in the command with 'j', and give the backup the right extension. That would make the command look like this: Code: tar cvpjf backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys / 2: Restoring Warning: Please, for goodness sake, be careful here. If you don't understand what you are doing here you might end up overwriting stuff that is important to you, so please take care! Well, we'll just continue with our example from the previous chapter; the file backup.tgz in the root of the partition. Once again, make sure you are root and that you and the backup file are in the root of the filesystem. One of the beautiful things of Linux is that This'll work even on a running system; no need to screw around with boot-cd's or anything. Of course, if you've rendered your system unbootable you might have no choice but to use a live-cd, but the results are the same. You can even remove every single file of a Linux system while it is running with one command. I'm not giving you that command though! Well, back on-topic. This is the command that I would use: Code: tar xvpfz backup.tgz -C / Or if you used bz2; Code: tar xvpfj backup.tar.bz2 -C / WARNING: this will overwrite every single file on your partition with the one in the archive! Just hit enter/return/your brother/whatever and watch the fireworks. Again, this might take a while. When it is done, you have a fully restored Ubuntu system! Just make sure that, before you do anything else, you re-create the directories you excluded: Code: mkdir proc mkdir lost+found mkdir mnt mkdir sys etc... And when you reboot, everything should be the way it was when you made the backup! 2.1: GRUB restore Now, if you want to move your system to a new harddisk or if you did something nasty to your GRUB (like, say, install Windows), You'll also need to reinstall GRUB. There are several very good howto's on how to do that here on this forum, so i'm not going to reinvent the wheel. Instead, take a look here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthre...t=grub+restore There are a couple of methods proposed. I personally recommend the second one, posted by remmelt, since that has always worked for me. Well that's it! I hope it was helpful! As always, any feedback is appreciated! setting up GRUB - https://askubuntu.com/questions/6317/how-can-i-install-windows-after-ive-installed-ubuntu/6321#6321\nHere's the general outline: Make space for Windows Install Windows Mount the /boot direcory or partition Install the bootloader (GRUB) Step One – Make space for Windows Open up GParted, and make sure that you have at least 20 GB available for Windows 7, either as a partition you can remove, or as unpartitioned space. If it's a partition, remove it from GRUB to make sure it doesn't break your Ubuntu install — GParted will complain if anything bad is about to happen. Make note of current /boot device. If that doesn't show up there, make note of the / device. The device name is something like sda5. Step Two – Install Windows Install Windows 7 into the space you just made Step Three – Mount /boot Note: Instead of mounting the boot directory or partition from the installation in the live media environment you can specify the path with the --boot-directory parameter for grub-install, more information on the manpage. Load up from your Ubuntu live CD, and then run these commands. If you DO NOT have a separate /boot partition: sudo mount /dev/DEVICENAME_FROM_STEP_ONE /mnt sudo rm -rf /boot # Careful here, make sure YOU ARE USING THE LIVE CD. I tried it, it works. sudo ln -s /mnt/boot /boot If you have a SEPARATE /boot partition: sudo mount /dev/DEVICENAME_FROM_STEP_ONE /boot Step Four – Install the bootloader Note: These instructions were initially written for Windows 7 and BIOS booting computers. If you have UEFI and Windows 8 and above you probably need to replace grub-pc with grub-efi-amd64 in sudo apt-get install grub-pc. Then continue with those commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install grub-pc sudo grub-install /dev/sda # NOTE THAT THERE IS NO DIGIT sudo umount /boot And restart. It should work fine and boot both systems.    https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=35087 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://www.huynle.com/essentials/ubuntu-essentials/","tags":null,"title":"Ubuntu Essentials"},{"categories":["projects","3d-printer"],"contents":"I realized it takes a very long time for the heated-bed to get up to temperature and start printing. This was one of the main reason why I did not use it as often as I originally intended.\nWith a slew of difficulties, e.g. Z-wobble and first layer not adhering to the board. The K8200 soon became a project of it\u0026rsquo;s own. In short, this is the start to making the K8200 be usable, as an everyday tool.\nIf you want to skip the details, jump to the [integration part][integration-header].\nObjective Before actually getting to update the K8200, I had to update the controller board. This is my fault for burning the Sanglougini board that came with the K8200.\nThis post will concentrate on understanding the make up of a controller board and its role in a 3D printer. Changed controller board to ([RAMPS 1.4][]) and [Arduino Mega 2560].\nBackground A controller for a 3D printer is a microcontroller with special circuitries to handle specifics of controller stepper motors.\nController Board There are many different version of controller boards that can be used for 3D printing and a couple of different configurations:\n Integrated microcontroller and stepper circuitries on one board Dedicated microcontroller and a shield that has all the circuities needed  The Sanglougini, chosen by Velleman for its K8200 printer, is the first of the two. It has the advantage of being small, integrated and \u0026lsquo;production\u0026rsquo; ready. This is not as much of a hackable solution of the two. The second configuration is something akin to an Arduino board that attaches to controller shield, like the RAMPS 1.4.\nDue to the budget, time constraint (not really, can\u0026rsquo;t get away from Amazon Prime), and the hack-ability, I went with the second option.\nThe Firmware The 3D printing community is very large and very active, therefore, we have countless of combinations and type of hardware that can drive a 3D printer, 3D cutter, bio-printer, etc. But in order for these controller to be able to send out meaningful signals that move the printhead to an exact location, it is dependent on the firmware.\nNot \u0026lsquo;hardware\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;software\u0026rsquo;, but \u0026lsquo;firmware\u0026rsquo;; somewhere in the middle that allows the software to interact with the hardware.\nFrom searching around, it seems to me that the Marlin firmware for 3D printing is a popular and widely supported option. Maybe thats why K8200 and almost all other 3D hobbyist 3D printer use it. [And because it supported this hardware configurations][marlin-hardware-support]. For the sake of time and drive to get K8200 to be a tool rather than a project, I stuck with the Marlin firmware for this upgrade. By doing so, it allows me to reuse some of the calibration constants and configurations that has already been defined by the K8200 original firmware.\nThe Final Setup Controller Board - [RAMPS1.4][amazon-ramp] + [Arduino Mega 2560][amazon-mega] (cheapest option on Amazon) Firmware - [Marlin][marlin-github]\nPutting it All Together As with any project, this section of the post only shows you the smooth path to project completion.\nFirmware for Arduino Mega 2560 Using Git T\nHardware Summary of hardware out there.

Secure Shell is a protocol that allows data to be transferred securely between client and server. Typically, the client (typically is you) to log onto a server (another computer) remotely.\nuses a pair of private and public keys.\nThese keys can be generated by a SSH key generator. There are different levels of security..\nLesson Learned Today, I have a fair grasp for what SSH is and its capabilities. Things that are common sense to me now, was not so a couple of years back. Looking back, these are some learnings\nClient or Server?\nThe Meat of It SSH Configurations The Outgoing\u0026hellip; Client side Pertains to \u0026lsquo;ssh_config\u0026rsquo;\n  Start with creating an ssh key   If there is authentication failures, you might want want add IdentitiesOnly yes in your config file.

The first argument should be the local port you wish to direct traffic to and the second argument should be the address and port that you wish to direct that traffic to on the remote end. RemoteForward: This option is used to define a remote port where traffic can be directed to in order to tunnel out of the local machine. The first argument should be the remote port where traffic will be directed on the remote system. The second argument should be the address and port to point the traffic to when it arrives on the local system. DynamicForward: This is used to configure a local port that can be used with a dynamic forwarding protocol like SOCKS5. Traffic using the dynamic forwarding protocol can then be directed at this port on the local machine and on the remote end, it will be routed according to the included values.\n This option might be using for timing to open a port\n ControlPersist: This option establishes the amount of time in seconds that the TCP connection should remain open after the final SSH connection has been closed. Setting this to a high number will allow you to open new connections after closing the first, but you can usually set this to something low like \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; to avoid keeping an unused TCP connection open.\n using SSH on chrome pay attention to chrome settings\nchrome://flags/\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=216233 enable-tcp-fast-open flag has to be set before?\n","permalink":"https://www.huynle.com/essentials/learning-ssh/","tags":["ghost"],"title":"Learning SSH"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I am a believer and a learner.
