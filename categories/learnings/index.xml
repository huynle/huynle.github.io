Extensions Extensions in Flask is named Flask_ There are a couple of ways that the extension can be initiated
Simple Method This simple method initiate the extension with the flask core app. the extension is exposed and can be used with others.
# settings.py SQLALCHEMY_SCHEMA_URI = &amp;#39;postgresql://username:password@host:port/database&amp;#39; # app.py from flask import Flask from flask.</description></item><item><title>SSL Protocol</title><link>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/ssl-protocol/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2017 04:42:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.huynle.com/learnings/ssl-protocol/</guid><description>Introduction Encryption use cryptographic pair, composed of a key and a certificate. Root pair is a cryptographic pair that is used to sign intermediates CAs.
Handshake SSL handshake uses asymmetric encryption first, then symmetric encryption after. Reason being, symmetric encryption is a lot faster.

This is good when you are developing on your own branches, but not good when we you working on public branch, more here
To merge or rebase master into a feature
git checkout feature git merge master # or.. a oneliner git merge master feature # say it in your head, git merge master into feature Rewriting history keeping a clean history is important This code snippets will allow you to interactively update commits for a particular branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
